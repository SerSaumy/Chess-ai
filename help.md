# Help Needed

This project is a chess game AI implemented in Python, and I need help in the following areas:

1. **AI Improvements**: The AI currently uses a basic evaluation function. I'm looking for ways to implement more sophisticated AI techniques like Minimax or Alpha-Beta pruning.
   
2. **Checkmate and Stalemate Logic**: While I've implemented basic logic for checking game over conditions, I need help with accurate checkmate and stalemate detection.

3. **Unit Testing**: I need assistance in writing more comprehensive unit tests for all the components of the game, including edge cases.

4. **Pawn Promotion**: Currently, pawn promotion logic is not implemented. Any guidance on how to handle this within the current design would be appreciated.
